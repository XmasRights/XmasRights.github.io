Hello there, and welcome to funcCode.

funcCode is a Swift programming blog that will guide you through the language one project at a time. This blog operates under the belief that the best way to learn how to program is to make as many mistakes as quickly as possible, and learn from each and every one.

Right now, there is no structure, and no real direction, but I encourage any feedback, comments, criticism, or kind words that you might have. You can get in touch with me at [funcCode@gmail.com](mailto:funcCode@gmail.com "A predictable email address").
