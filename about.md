## About
funcCode is a Swift Programming blog run by Christopher Fonseka, a Software Engineer from London, UK.

At some point Chris (who apparently writes in third person all of a sudden) will fill this page with relatively uninteresting details about himself, but today is not that day.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, or would like to get in touch with me, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/XmasRights">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/XmasRights">Github</a>, or at [funcCode@gmail.com](mailto:funcCode@gmail.com "A predictable email address").
