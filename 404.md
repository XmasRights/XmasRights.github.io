404 - Page not found
====================
Well, this is awkward. You appear to be on a page that doesn't exist.

Actually, this explanation that it does not exist gives the page existence and meaning; though it's likely not the kind of page that you were looking for. Evidently we need more error codes to cover the philosophical journey you've had in getting here.

In the meantime, you can make your way back to a better defined page [by clicking here]({{ site.baseurl }}).
